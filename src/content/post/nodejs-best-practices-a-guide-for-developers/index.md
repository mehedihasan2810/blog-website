Nodejs is a powerful tool for building fast and scalable web applications. However, to get most out to nodejs it is important to follow best practices. In this blog post, we will explore some key best practices for nodejs development.

## 1. Structure Your Project

A well-structured project is easy to maintain and scale. Here's a simple structure that you can follow:

```bash
my-node-app/
│
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── services/
│
├── tests/
│
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Explanation:

- `src/` contains your main application code.
  - `controllers/` handle the logic for your app.
  - `models/` define your data structures.
  - `routes/` manage the different endpoints of your API.
  - `services/` contain business logic.
- `tests/` contain all the test files.
- `.env` stores your environment variables
- `.gitignore` specifies files to ignore in GIT.
- `.package.json` keeps track of dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md` describes your project.

## 2. Use Environment Variables

Environment variables help keep your configuration settings outside your code. This makes your app more secure and easier to manage.

Example:
Create a `.env` file:

```bash title=".env"
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
```

Load these variables in your code using the `dotenv` package:

```js
require("dotenv").config();

const dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;
const dbUser = process.env.DB_USER;
const dbPass = process.env.DB_PASS;

console.log(`Connecting to database at ${dbHost} with user ${dbUser}`);
```

## 3. Handle Errors Properly

Handling error properly ensures that your app doesn't crash unexpectedly.

```js
app.get("/user/:id", async (req, res, next) => {
	try {
		const user = await getUserById(req.params.id);
		if (!user) {
			return res.status(404).send("User not found");
		}
		res.send(user);
	} catch (error) {
		next(error);
	}
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
	console.error(err.stack);
	res.status(500).send("Something went wrong!");
});
```

## 4. Use Asynchronous Code

Nodejs is asynchronous by nature. Use `async` and `await` to handle asynchronous code more cleanly.

Example:

```js
async function fetchData() {
	try {
		const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
		const data = await response.json();
		console.log(data);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
	}
}

fetchData();
```

## 5. Keep Dependencies Updated

Regularly update your dependencies to ensure you have latest features and security fixes.

Use `npm outdated` to check for outdated packages.

```
npm outdated
```

Update packages:

```
npm update
```

## 6. Write Tests

Testing your code helps catch bug early and ensures that your app works
as expected.

Example:
**Step 1: Install `Jest`**

```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

**Step 2: Write tests**
Create test file, for example, `tests/example.test.js`. Here's a simple example to get you started.

```js title="tests/example.test.js"
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
	expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

## 7. Use A Linter

Linters help you write clean and consistent code. ESLint is a popular choice.

Example:

Install ESLint:

```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

Initialize ESLint:

```
npx eslint --init
```

Add a lint script to your `package.json`:

```js title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint ."
}
```

Run the linter:

```
npm run lint
```

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you write better, more maintainable nodejs application. Remember to structure your project, use environmental variables, handle errors properly, write asynchronous code, keep dependencies updated, write tests and use a linter. By doing so, you will create robust and efficient nodejs applications that are easier to manage and maintain.

Happy Coding!
